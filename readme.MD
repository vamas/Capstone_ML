# Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project

In this Python project I'm using using supervised regression learning algorithms to predict future prices for the given period. Source data used in the project are publicly available S&P500 companiesâ€™ historical stock prices dataset that can be obtained from Yahoo! Finance web-service. Detailed implementation is described in CapstoneProject_Implementation.pdf file.
